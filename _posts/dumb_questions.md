So today I was looking at Quora, and there was this questions about simple arithmetics, like "6*6+6-6" or even worse. And I asked myself, if is it something complicated for certains persons or it is cause of poor education. 
But suddenly, I understood some interesting moment. It doesn't matter how simple do you find this questions, for you there exist plenty another questions, that for some peaple are synonymum to that "2*2".
There is never an absolut, the answer to all of questions in the word. THere is just an large space of unknown, but ready to be discovered by you.
