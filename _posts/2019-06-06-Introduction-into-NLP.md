Let it be the first post in the series of abut Natural Language Processing. I'll create them in the course of my research for work.

I start with one important part for machine learning, that often can be more important and play essential role in the quality of the learning of model. It's data peprocessing.
 
 All etapes , that I'll describe here are specific for preprocessing text data. Also depending on the algorithm and the model you are going to use, some can be skept or even are harmful. We'll talk about it later.
 
 Now, I want to introduce some standart etapes, that you' ll find in almost every blog or book with NLP. That's:
 
 <ul>
  <li>Lower every character in text </li>
  <li>Delete punctuation</li>
  <li>Delete stopwords (special words, that help to create a sense in sentences, but have no impact in the actually a sense)</li>
  <li>Find the most frequent and the least frequent words in the text, delete them if needed</li>
  <li>Lemmatize text</li>
  <li>Stemmatisation</li>
  <li>Tokanisation </li>
 </ul>

And there are few etapes in preprocessing, that I found useful in case of my data:

<ul>
 <li>If your data in other latin language then English, try to change special characters for the standard. Let me give you an example, In french we have è;é;à etc. that I changed for e,e,a consequently. </li>
 <li></li>
 <li></li>
 <li></li>
 
</ul>
