  As you know, internet start to explose with the number of differents articles, tutorials, videos and courses about Machine Learning. Some of them are good, some not. And what is the most important, very few of them are good in explaining algoritms. Also as every human being is different, the comprahansion of information for every induvidual is different. It's where we need to try differents literature for find the most effective way to understand.
 
  There is my short list of books, that I use and that were recommended by several teachers for studying:
  
  <ul>
  <li> "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective". Kevin P. Murphy. The MIT Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England. 2012</li>
  <li> "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning". Christopher M. Bishop. 2006 Springer</li>
  <li>"Deep Learning" . Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville. Can find here: <a href='www.deeplearningbook.org'> www.deeplearningbook.org </a> </li>
  </ul>
